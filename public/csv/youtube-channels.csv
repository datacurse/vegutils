About ten years ago we started looking for property in New Mexico. More recently we started looking for un-permitted areas to move to. We searched many areas and researched their permit and inspection requirements. Many areas allow for owner builds however there are restrictions and some hoops to jump through.   Early in 2017 we found the city of Terlingua in far west Texas in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert where you can not only buy land on the cheap but you are also allowed to build pretty much anything you like :) By May we bought our property and over the next year and a half we sold our house, closed up the datacenter and made preparations for our move. On December 19, 2019 we arrived at our property.  Thanks for stopping by :)   For questions and business inquires feel free to email us.   Or mail us at: Theodore & Lisa Pound P.O.

I love to cook and I am always happy to share my recipes with everyone. I had been vegetarian in my twenties but eventually went back to eating meat and dairy. As time went on I wanted to return to a more plant based diet.   I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 2008 and went gluten free while still eating the standard American diet (SAD). In 2011 I watched Forks Over Knives, after that I went vegetarian for a month then went totally vegan but still ate a lot of vegan junk food.  In 2012 I was diagnosed with Autoimmune Hepatitis and decided to eat a whole food plant based diet to help heal myself.  I have been in remission since the beginning of 2013 and I even ran a 1/2 marathon that October. So as you can see it was a long process   Are you wondering if a plant based diet is right for you?

I believe the only way we can achieve the dream of a vegan world and  Animal Liberation is by having more Activists, from chalking, posting online to Street demonstrations and DXE. Content will be on different types of ARA, interviews with activists. Three of the main reasons people aren't active are Anxiety, Not knowing how to get involved, Time constraints. I plan content on how to overcome these and others. If you manage to influence 3 people a month into becoming vegan and they in turn influence 3 people and so on, in a year you would have contributed to 177,147 people going Vegan. Just think what the numbers would be with more ARA. The stats are out there, a vegan world is coming, but we need to act now.

I realized that giving up dairy and eggs was not as hard as I thought.   During my hiking adventures, I learned finding cruelty free gear can be a difficult task. I made this channel to share some of my knowledge I have gained about vegan and cruelty free gear. I also wanted to share all of these beautiful views with you and what you might expect should you try these hikes! I hike all over the country and spend most of my time in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.   One thing to note: Sometimes gear that is not cruelty free can sneak by. I have found this happens especially when companies have outsourced a lot of their manufacturing. It is always best to be as thorough as possible in our search for the best gear, but in the end we can only do our best to be cruelty free.   Please feel free to give feedback and enjoy!

My partner and I were both sick of the rat race, so 7 years ago we left our comfortable life in the city to follow our dream of growing our own food and living off-grid. We used all our money to buy 12 acres of rainforest in QLD, Australia. We lived in a tent for the first few years. We had no shower, so we bathed in the creek. We then made an outdoor shower connected to the creek. We had no toilet, so we made a composting toilet and attached a water sprayer. We had no electricity until we got solar panels. We wanted food freedom, so from the beginning we planted fruit trees. We have planted over 1,000. We used the bamboo from the land to build primitive technology. In my late 30's I finally learned to make my own clothes, crochet, and use palm leaves from the land to weave into bags and mats. I am really growing out here - even my leg hair! This is the life for us, and here we inspire you to also move off grid and grow your own food. Follow for more!

I also help women lose excess jiggle, & keep it off. No restriction or unhealthy fads. No animals harmed in the process. If you are sick of the diet culture merry-go-round then this is the channel for you. I lost 40lbs & have maintained for 10+yrs on the raw till 4 vegan diet (one of my popular books). In 2005 I ran a personal training business & gained certification in weight management, nutrition, advanced aerobic conditioning & advanced resistance training from the fitness institute of Australia. I am a fruit-based nutritionist who has studied nutrition at two institutions. So, although I have a conventional education in nutrition, my real life results came from my own non-stop research in a quest to find the optimal diet & lifestyle for a permanent lean healthy body.

UCUkT0V_p3GPLp8im0s_2Abg,Veganika,"As vegan, animal rights activist I want to focus on critical analysis of the doctrines of Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism and their ethical principles. I am open to debate this topic with anyone - believer or atheist - send me an email if you want to talk. I intend to ask difficult questions to followers of Abrahamic religions and I hope I will make some people revise their views. Additionally, I am interested in cosmology and quantum physics, so I can also make videos from these fields, especially in the context of religious doctrines and veganism. Yes, I believe that these fields teach us the most about reality and that includes the role of animals in this world. And since I also produce a lot of educational videos on dietetics in my own language, Polish, it is possible that once a while some will also appear here in English.
